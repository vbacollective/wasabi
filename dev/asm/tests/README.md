# Assembly Payloads and Thunks for VBA

> [!NOTE]
> This suite provides safe, contained environments to verify memory allocation, parameter passing, and raw machine code execution across architectures within VBA.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technical Purpose:** Calling raw machine code from VBA requires tricking the host environment (Excel/Access/Word) using the `CallWindowProcW` API. These test files verify that the bridging mechanism (the "Thunk") handles pointer arithmetic, registers, and stack cleanup correctly without crashing the application.

### The VBA Assembly Execution Concept

In standard VBA, executing raw machine code natively is not supported. This limitation is typically bypassed by allocating executable memory (`VirtualAlloc` on Windows or `mmap` on macOS), injecting binary opcodes, and using `CallWindowProcW` as a bridge to redirect execution flow.

However, different CPU architectures handle parameters differently:
1. **x64 (FastCall / Microsoft x64 Calling Convention):** Parameters are passed via hardware registers (`RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, `R9`). The result is returned in `RAX`.
2. **x86 (stdcall):** Parameters are pushed to the stack (`[ebp+8]`, `[ebp+12]`, etc.). The assembly code is responsible for cleaning up the stack before returning (`ret 16`). The result is returned in `EAX`.

If these conventions are violated (e.g., failing to clean the stack in x86), an immediate and fatal **Host Crash** occurs. These test cases are explicitly written to adhere to these strict calling conventions.

### The Payloads

Beyond simple stability, this suite covers various CPU operations, memory manipulations, and logic loops to handle high-performance tasks directly in machine code:

*   **Math Addition (`add_numbers`)**: Tests standard parameter passing and integer return values.
*   **Memory Copy (`mem_copy`)**: A high-speed `memcpy` equivalent to test pointer manipulation and the `rep movsb` instruction.
*   **XOR Buffer (`xor_buffer`)**: Tests bitwise cryptography, loops, and byte-level manipulation within an allocated VBA byte array.
*   **String Length (`str_len`)**: Tests high-speed memory scanning (`repne scasb`) by finding the null-terminator of a string.
*   **Memory Set (`mem_set`)**: A `memset` equivalent to test rapid byte filling (`rep stosb`).
*   **Count Byte (`count_byte`)**: Tests conditional jumps (`cmp`, `jne`) by counting specific byte occurrences in a buffer.
*   **Memory Search (`mem_chr`)**: A `memchr` equivalent that tests searching for a specific needle (1 byte) in a haystack buffer and returning its exact memory address.
*   **Memory Reverse (`mem_reverse`)**: Tests complex two-pointer manipulation (reading from the left and right simultaneously) to reverse an array in-place.

### Implementation Details

These thunks are designed to be injected into executable memory at runtime. Memory must be allocated using API calls like `VirtualAlloc` with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` permissions. 

To prevent memory leaks, you must always free the allocated memory using `VirtualFree` (or `munmap` on Mac) after the payload has finished executing or when the host application is closing. For sensitive data, a secure wipe (zeroing the memory) before freeing is recommended.

## Compilation and Verification

To test and verify these Assembly thunks, you need to assemble the `.asm` source files into raw machine code (binary format).

### 1. Required Tooling: NASM

The Netwide Assembler (NASM) is the industry standard for this task. It outputs raw binary files without the overhead of OS headers (like PE or ELF).

1. Download the NASM executable from [nasm.us](https://www.nasm.us/).
2. Add the NASM directory to your Windows System PATH or run it directly from the folder.

### 2. Compilation Commands

You must compile these files using the `-f bin` flag to ensure the output is a pure stream of processor instructions.

#### Example for x64
```bash
nasm -f bin xor_x64.asm -o xor_x64.bin
```

#### Example for x86
```bash
nasm -f bin xor_x86.asm -o xor_x86.bin
```

### 3. Extracting Opcodes for VBA

Once you have the `.bin` files, you can load them directly via a binary file reader in VBA, or you can extract the opcodes to hardcode them into your project as Byte Arrays.

#### Method A: Using Windows CertUtil (Built-in)
```bash
certutil -dump xor_x64.bin
```

#### Method B: Using PowerShell
```powershell
[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("xor_x64.bin") | ForEach-Object { "0x{0:X2}" -f $_ } | Join-String -Separator ", "
```

### 4. Integration Concept

Once compiled, the payload can be executed by passing pointers and arguments directly to the memory address. A conceptual execution flow in VBA looks like this:

```vba
Sub TestXorPayload()
    Dim buffer() As Byte
    Dim pBuffer As LongPtr
    
    ' 1. Setup Test Data
    buffer = StrConv("Hello World", vbFromUnicode)
    pBuffer = VarPtr(buffer(0))
    
    ' 2. Assuming `pExecMemory` is your allocated PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE block
    ' containing the loaded xor_x64.bin opcodes...
    
    ' 3. Run the payload via CallWindowProcW (P1 = Buffer Ptr, P2 = Length, P3 = Key)
    ' CallWindowProcW pExecMemory, pBuffer, UBound(buffer) + 1, &HAA, 0
    
    ' Result: buffer() is now encrypted in-place with XOR key 0xAA
End Sub
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Always ensure you are compiling and injecting the correct binary architecture (`x86` vs `x64`). Running a 32-bit payload on a 64-bit Office installation (or vice versa) will result in an immediate application crash.
