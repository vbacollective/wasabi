# Wasabi Benchmark Suite

> [!WARNING]
> These benchmark tests can only be run within the ![](../resources/svg/ms-excel.svg) **Microsoft Excel** environment.

This folder contains a self-contained benchmark harness for Wasabi's
core primitives. It measures raw CPU throughput, independent of network
latency, using the same native Windows APIs that Wasabi calls internally.

## What is tested

| Operation        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SHA‑1** | Cryptographic hash used during the WebSocket handshake (CryptoAPI)          |
| **Base64Encode** | Encoder used for handshake keys and proxy auth (`CryptBinaryToStringW`)     |
| **StringToUtf8** | Conversion from VBA String to UTF‑8 bytes (`WideCharToMultiByte`)           |
| **Utf8ToString** | Conversion from UTF‑8 bytes to VBA String (`MultiByteToWideChar`)           |
| **BuildWSFrame** | Full WebSocket frame construction, including **`RtlGenRandom`** kernel entropy and **ASM `ws_mask`** execution |

## Prerequisites

1. **Wasabi.bas** must be in the same VBA project.
2. The 7 public wrapper functions listed at the bottom of
   `WasabiBenchmark.bas` must be added to `Wasabi.bas`.

## How to run

1. Import `WasabiBenchmark.bas` into your VBA project.
2. Run `WasabiBenchmark_RunAll` from the Immediate Window or Macro dialog.

## Interpreting the results

- **Avg Latency (µs)** – average microseconds per operation.
- **Throughput (MB/s)** – how many megabytes per second the operation processes.
- **Ops/s (k)** – thousands of operations per second.

The suite uses `QueryPerformanceCounter` for sub‑millisecond accuracy and
automatically adapts iteration counts to the payload size.

## Reference chart

The chart plots throughput against payload size on a logarithmic scale,
highlighting the performance difference between operations.
