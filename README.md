## What is Wasabi

Wasabi is a VBA module designed to make WebSocket and TCP communication simple, predictable, and practical, bringing an experience similar to [socket.io](https://socket.io) in Node.js entirely within the Office ecosystem. It is a single, self-contained `.bas` file that compiles seamlessly on 32-bit and 64-bit Office hosts, from Windows XP to Windows 11.

Beyond basic WebSocket messaging, Wasabi bundles an MQTT 3.1.1 client, NTLM/Kerberos proxy authentication, RTT latency measurement, fine-grained TLS certificate control, and `permessage-deflate` compression (RFC 7692), all without mandatory external dependencies.

## Why Wasabi Exists

VBA is excellent for automation and integration with Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and other Office applications, but it hits a wall when real-time communication is required. In practice, anyone trying to build a project that depends on live messaging usually runs into three problems:

- **No standardization:** There is no official, modern path for sockets and WebSockets in VBA.
- **Verbose low-level APIs:** The most common options require a lot of infrastructure code just to connect and maintain a stable session.
- **Limited event-driven patterns:** It is common to end up with loops, timers, and control logic just to simulate something that other languages handle natively.

## Why a Standard Module (.bas) instead of Classes (.cls)?

A common architectural question is why Wasabi is implemented as a standard procedural module rather than an Object-Oriented class. This design is a deliberate strategic choice to maximize performance, stability, and compatibility within the specific constraints of the VBA environment.

### 1. Zero COM Overhead

In VBA, every Class is technically a **COM (Component Object Model) Object**. Instantiating, invoking methods via IDispatch, and managing reference counting adds significant overhead. By using a standard `.bas` module, Wasabi communicates directly with the CPU and memory, eliminating the COM layer and providing the high-speed execution required for real-time networking.

### 2. Static Connection Pool & Data-Oriented Design

Wasabi manages up to 64 concurrent connections using a statically allocated pool of **User-Defined Types (UDTs)**. 
* **Memory Predictability:** All connection data resides in a contiguous block of memory, which is much more cache-friendly than objects scattered across the heap.
* **No Heap Fragmentation:** Objects are frequently allocated and destroyed, which can lead to memory fragmentation in long-running Office sessions. Wasabi's static pool is allocated once at startup and recycled, ensuring long-term stability without memory leaks.

### 3. Native Win32 API Alignment

Working with low-level networking requires heavy use of memory pointers (`StrPtr`, `VarPtr`) and direct memory manipulation (`RtlMoveMemory`). 
* Standard modules provide a flatter, more reliable memory model for passing data to Windows Kernel and Security APIs.
* Passing class properties to Win32 APIs often requires temporary buffering or extra copies; procedural modules allow "in-place" processing, which is essential for the **Zero-Copy** receive model.

### 4. Minimal Integration Friction

Using Wasabi does not require the developer to manage object lifecycles or worry about variables falling out of scope and terminating connections unexpectedly. 
* State is managed globally through a simple integer **Handle**. 
* This "Plug-and-Play" approach mimics how the Windows Kernel itself manages resources, providing a robust interface for both beginner and advanced developers.

### 5. Developer Experience: Global Typings & Enums

Wasabi is engineered to maximize developer productivity by leveraging the global scope of standard modules. By using Public Enums and Types, we provide a superior **IntelliSense** experience compared to Class-based libraries:

* **Global Constants:** Access connection states (e.g., `STATE_OPEN`, `STATE_CLOSED`) and error codes anywhere in your project without instantiating objects.
* **Strongly Typed Structures:** Use native Types like `WasabiStats` for high-performance data handling and telemetry.
* **Zero-Friction API:** Functions like `WebSocketGetLastError` return specific Enum values, allowing for clean `Select Case` blocks and self-documenting code.

> [!TIP]
> This architecture transforms Wasabi from a simple script into a high-performance networking engine, bringing C-level memory management and stability to the VBA ecosystem.

## The Assembly Engine (Thunks)

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/using-assembly.png" alt="Wasabi Assembly Engine" />
</div>

To achieve true C-level performance in operations where native VBA traditionally struggles, Wasabi integrates a microscopic **Assembly Engine** directly into the module. 

VBA is an interpreted language that excels at COM automation, but it is inherently slow at processing large byte arrays sequentially. Operations like masking payload frames or scanning massive TCP buffers for delimiters require loops (`For i = 0 To...`) with heavy overhead due to bounds-checking and variant type conversions. 

To bypass this bottleneck, Wasabi uses **Safe Thunks**—compiled machine code (x86 and x64) injected directly into executable memory at runtime.

### How It Works

1. **Allocation:** Upon initialization, Wasabi uses the Windows API `VirtualAlloc` to request a block of memory with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` permissions.
2. **Injection:** The raw hexadecimal opcodes of the Assembly functions are copied into this allocated memory block using `RtlMoveMemory`.
3. **Execution:** Whenever a heavy byte-level operation is required, Wasabi delegates the task to the processor using `CallWindowProcW`. This API acts as a bridge, tricking the OS into executing our allocated memory block as if it were a standard C function.

### The High-Performance Thunks

When Wasabi needs to process intense data, it routes the heavy mathematics directly to the silicon:

* **`ws_mask`**: Applies the mandatory WebSocket XOR mask (RFC 6455) to outbound frames in microseconds. It completely eliminates the VBA `For` loop bottleneck, allowing the client to mask megabytes of payload instantly.
* **`mem_zero`**: An ultra-fast hardware-level memory wipe. It utilizes the highly optimized `rep stosb` x86 instruction during connection cleanup to securely erase decrypted payloads, buffers, and proxy credentials from RAM.
* **`mem_find`**: Hardware-accelerated byte-pattern matching (the "Needle in a Haystack" problem). It uses the `repe cmpsb` instruction to instantly locate delimiters (like `\r\n`) within massive TCP buffers, an operation that would otherwise freeze the Office UI if done in native VBA.

These thunks are deeply encapsulated. As a developer, you simply call the high-level API functions, while the engine autonomously manages the execution flow.

### Dive Deeper: The [`dev/asm`](dev/asm) Directory

For transparency, maintainability, and community contributions, the original Assembly source code is not hidden. You can find all the raw `.asm` files in the **[`dev/asm`](dev/asm)** folder of this repository.

Inside `dev/asm`, you will find:
* **The Source Code:** Uncompiled, heavily commented NASM/FASM code for all the thunks (`ws_mask_x64.asm`, `mem_find_x86.asm`, etc.).
* **Calling Conventions:** Documentation on how the thunks handle arguments across different architectures. 
  * **x64:** Uses the *Microsoft x64 calling convention* (passing arguments via `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, `R9`).
  * **x86:** Uses the `stdcall` convention (arguments pushed to the stack, requiring `ret 16` to clean up the stack pointer).
* **Safe Thunk (Anti-Crash):** Additional experimental thunks designed to protect the runtime against the "VBE Reset Problem" (preventing Excel from crashing if the VBA project is stopped abruptly while a socket is listening).
* **Compilation Guide:** Instructions on how to use `nasm -f bin` to compile modifications and generate the hexadecimal byte arrays required for the main `.bas` module.

## What VBA limitations it solves

Working with networking in VBA often becomes a project of its own. Wasabi addresses typical pain points directly:

**Winsock and Windows API calls**
- Requires zero low-level declarations, structs, or callbacks in your actual project code.
- Shields your application from API breaking changes across Windows versions.

**Security & Cryptography**
- Uses `SystemFunction036` (`RtlGenRandom`) for RFC-compliant frame masking instead of VBA's predictable `Rnd`.
- Handles native TLS 1.2/1.3 via Schannel SSPI without relying on outdated Internet Explorer settings or registry keys.

**Corporate Environments**
- **Auto-Proxy Discovery:** Resolves corporate proxies and PAC scripts automatically using `winhttp.dll`.
- **NTLM/Kerberos:** Transparently authenticates against secure proxies using the current logged-in Windows credentials.

**HTTP is not WebSocket**
- Even with WinHTTP or MSXML, you are in a request/response world.
- Real-time scenarios turn into polling, long-polling or workarounds that consume resources and increase latency.

**Maintenance and readability**
- Most handcrafted solutions grow long and fragile.
- The networking layer becomes the largest part of the project, making simple things hard to maintain.

**Modern Asynchronous Networking**
- Eliminates polling or long-polling HTTP workarounds.
- Maintains a stable, low-latency connection without freezing the Office UI.

**Reliability**
- **Offline Queueing:** Messages sent during a disconnect are safely buffered in memory and automatically flushed when `AutoReconnect` succeeds.
- **Ping Jitter:** Adds pseudo-random variance to keepalive pings to bypass strict anti-bot gateway filters.

**Built-in IoT and Diagnostics**
- Provides native standard MQTT 3.1.1 protocol handling out of the box (`MqttConnect`, `MqttPublish`, `MqttSubscribe`).
- **QoS 1 & 2 MQTT:** Implements a real In-Flight queue with Packet ID tracking, ensuring messages are acknowledged and delivered Exactly Once (PUBREC/PUBREL/PUBCOMP).
- **MTU Discovery:** Dynamically tunes frame sizes to match network segments, preventing IP fragmentation.

**Raw TCP beyond HTTP and WebSocket**
- Most VBA networking solutions are locked to HTTP or WebSocket. Wasabi now includes a full native TCP client that shares the same handle pool, TLS stack, proxy infrastructure, and MTU discovery engine.
- `TcpConnect` and `TcpConnectTLS` let you talk to any TCP server — SMTP, custom binary protocols, industrial equipment, or internal APIs — with the same one-liner ergonomics as WebSocket.

## Use Cases

- **Bots and Chat Integrations:** Connect to Discord, Slack, or Telegram gateways and handle real-time events directly from Excel or Word.
- **Trading and Finance:** Stream live market data from exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or B3 into spreadsheet cells with millisecond-level latency.
- **Live Dashboards:** Update live data on a spreadsheet seamlessly without manual refreshes or HTTP endpoint polling.
- **IoT and Industrial SCADA:** Receive sensor data from ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or PLC systems via WebSocket or MQTT natively into Office.
- **Games and Interactive Tools:** Build reliable client/server communication for VBA-based multiplayer games or collaborative tools.
- **Corporate Automation:** Connect Office to internal WebSocket APIs behind firewalls and proxies without requiring IT to install third-party software.
- **Raw TCP Automation:** Communicate directly with TCP servers, legacy PLC systems, industrial equipment, or custom protocols that don't speak WebSocket or HTTP.

## Performance

All cryptographic and encoding primitives are delegated to native Windows
APIs (`advapi32.dll` / `crypt32.dll`). This yields throughput close to the
hardware limit, even inside the VBA runtime.

![Throughput Benchmark](resources/benchmark-throughput.png)

> [!NOTE]
> SHA‑1 now runs at **400 MB/s** (down from 1.8 s per 128 KB in pure VBA).
> Base64 operations stay around **41 MB/s**, UTF‑8 conversion exceeds
> **1 GB/s**, and WebSocket frame construction tops **25 MB/s**.
>
> The test harness and raw data are in [`benchmark/`](benchmark/).

## Compatibility

Wasabi was designed to run without any external dependencies, using exclusively
native Windows DLLs that ship with every version of Windows. No references need
to be enabled in **Tools → References**, no COM components need to be registered,
and no third-party installers are required. Dropping the `.bas` file into a VBA
project is all it takes.

### Operating System

| Version | Support |
|---|---|
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows XP | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg)|
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows Vista | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows 7 | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows 8 / 8.1 | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows 10 | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/windows.svg) Windows 11 | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |

Wasabi relies on `ws2_32.dll`, `secur32.dll`, `kernel32.dll`, `advapi32.dll`, and `crypt32.dll`. These libraries are present in every version of Windows since XP, which is why Wasabi runs on machines over 20 years old without modifications.

This is a deliberate architectural choice. Many competing modules depend on the `WinHttpWebSocket*` family of functions (`WinHttpWebSocketSend`, `WinHttpWebSocketReceive`, `WinHttpWebSocketCompleteUpgrade`) introduced only in Windows 8. As a result, those modules silently fail on Windows 7 machines, which remain common in corporate and industrial environments. Wasabi has no such limitation.

### Office and VBA

| Environment | Support |
|---|---|
| ![](resources/svg/ms-excel.svg) Excel 32-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-excel.svg) Excel 64-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-word.svg) Word 32-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-word.svg) Word 64-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-powerpoint.svg) PowerPoint 32-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-powerpoint.svg) PowerPoint 64-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-access.svg) Access 32-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-access.svg) Access 64-bit | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-office.svg) Any VBA7 host (Office 2010+) | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/ms-office.svg) VBA6 (Office 2007 and earlier) | ![](resources/svg/checked.svg) |

The transition from 32-bit to 64-bit Office broke many VBA modules that used
native API declarations. Wasabi handles this transparently through conditional
compilation.

Every API declaration uses `#If VBA7` to switch between `Long` (32-bit) and
`LongPtr`/`PtrSafe` (64-bit). The same `.bas` file works correctly on Office
2007 32-bit and Office 365 64-bit on Windows 11.

> 32-bit and 64-bit compatibility is guaranteed through conditional compilation (`#If VBA7`) across all API declarations.

### Native DLLs

| Library | Role in Wasabi | Optional |
|---|---|:---:|
| <img src="resources/ms-vba.png" width="18" /> `ws2_32.dll` | TCP socket creation, DNS, send/recv | ![](resources/svg/thumbsdown.svg) |
| <img src="resources/ms-vba.png" width="18" /> `secur32.dll` | TLS 1.2/1.3 via Schannel SSPI | ![](resources/svg/thumbsdown.svg) |
| <img src="resources/ms-vba.png" width="18" /> `kernel32.dll` | Memory operations, UTF-8, tick count | ![](resources/svg/thumbsdown.svg) |
| <img src="resources/ms-vba.png" width="18" /> `advapi32.dll` | Cryptographic random numbers (`SystemFunction036`) | ![](resources/svg/thumbsdown.svg) |
| <img src="resources/ms-vba.png" width="18" /> `crypt32.dll` | Certificate store, chain validation | ![](resources/svg/thumbsdown.svg) |
| ![](resources/svg/dependence.svg) `zlib1.dll` | Compression for `permessage-deflate` | ![](resources/svg/thumbsup.svg) |

**What does "zero external dependencies" mean in practice?**
Wasabi requires nothing beyond Windows and the standard VBA runtime. There is no installer, no COM registration, no ActiveX control, no third-party DLL, no Python runtime, no .NET package, and no `regsvr32`. 

The only optional component is `zlib1.dll`, needed strictly if you enable `permessage-deflate`. The module detects its presence automatically and works perfectly without it. This is highly beneficial in corporate environments where IT policies prevent software installation. You can distribute a workbook containing Wasabi without asking the user to install anything first.

## Compression (permessage-deflate)

Wasabi supports the WebSocket `permessage-deflate` extension (RFC 7692), which
compresses message payloads to reduce bandwidth usage.

- Compression is **opt-in** on a per‑connection basis
- Requires `zlib1.dll` (see [Native DLLs](#native-dlls) and [DEFLATE.md](docs/DEFLATE.md))
- Automatically negotiates with the server during handshake
- Falls back gracefully if the server doesn't support compression or the DLL is missing

```vb
' Connect with compression enabled
If WebSocketConnect("wss://[example.com/ws](https://example.com/ws)", h, True, True) Then
    Debug.Print "Compression active:", WebSocketGetDeflateEnabled(h)
End If
```

> [!NOTE]
> `permessage-deflate` reduces bandwidth, not latency. It's most beneficial for
> large payloads or connections with limited bandwidth. For small messages, the
> CPU overhead may slightly outweigh the bandwidth savings.

## Execution Model: Single-Thread and Polling

VBA is single-threaded. One execution thread is shared between your code and
the Office interface, so there is no native background socket listening.

Wasabi uses a polling model: incoming messages accumulate in internal buffers
and are delivered when you call `WebSocketReceive`.

Each `WebSocketReceive` call:
1. Runs maintenance (pings, inactivity timeout, MTU probes)
2. Checks the OS socket buffer (`FIONREAD`)
3. Reads available data
4. Decrypts (if TLS) and parses WebSocket frames
5. Returns the oldest queued message

Between calls, the socket stays open and the kernel buffers incoming data.
No messages are lost.

- **Not slow.** The ring buffer holds up to 512 messages.
- **Connection doesn't drop.** The socket stays active regardless of polling frequency.
- **No infinite loop required.** Simple send/receive/disconnect workflows work fine.
